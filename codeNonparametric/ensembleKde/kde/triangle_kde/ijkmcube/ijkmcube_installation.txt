1) Extracted ijkmcube, isotable and lib are on path 
prj_dir = codeNonparametric\ensembleKde\kde\triangle_kde\

2) Navigate to prj_dir/ijkmcube folder (and delete CMakeCache.txt if one exists)

3) Now, reconfigure project using following commands:

-Type "ccmake ." and "c" twice to configure.

-Check that IJK_DIR is set to project directory. [Here: prj_dir]
